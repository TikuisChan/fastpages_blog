    "<a href=\"www.kaggle.com\">Kaggle</a> held a <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml\">30 days of ML challenge</a> aimming to help people to get start with Data Science and Machine Learning (\"Machine learning beginner â†’ Kaggle competitor in 30 days. Non-coders welcome.\" they claimed). During the challenge Kaggle will send an email to participants everyday assiging a task (maybe read a tutorial or finish an exercise). At the first 14 days are the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning\">Intro to Machine Learning</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning\">Intermediate Machine Learning</a>. In this blog I will share what I've learnt in the Intro to Machine Learning course of Kaggle."

As a intro to Machine Learning this is a very good starting point.\n",
