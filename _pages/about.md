Keeping blogging is not easy, especially when one of your majoy source of learning is blogs written by different experts, which makes my blog looks stupid...

It is not the first time I tried to build a blog since the beginning of 2020 when I start learning Python and Machine Learning. I've tried blogger and build a static page hosting in github, those experience are not so good at all, mainly because of my ignorance (don't know how and where to start) and laziness (it is hard to keep up if you have to update a post with tons of works to make it looks reasonable :P). A year later, I landed my new position as a Data Scientist, learnt a bit more, it seems to be a good time to restart :)
