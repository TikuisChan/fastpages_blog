# HI !

## 20-3-2021
It is not the first time I tried to build a blog recording what I've learnt since I start learning Python and Machine Learning at the beginning of 2020. Previous experience are not so good at all, mainly because of my ignorance (don't know where to start) and laziness (it is hard to keep up if you have to update a post with tons of works to make it looks reasonable :P). After a year, I got my job as a Data Scientist, built up some skills in coding, it seems to be a good time to restart the blog :)
